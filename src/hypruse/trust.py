"""Trust layers for a shared human/agent seat.

Opt-in constraints, each gated by an env var, that limit what an agent can
touch and make its presence legible. They compose with the always-on
approval and beacon layers; none persists anything, and every one fails
toward LESS action, never more.

  HYPRUSE_CONFINE     restrict input to a scope of windows:
                      `launched` (only windows hypruse itself opened),
                      `class:foo,bar`, or `workspace:3,special:notes`
  HYPRUSE_AUTH_GUARD  refuse to drive polkit/authentication dialogs
                      (default on; per-call allow_auth overrides). Set it
                      to `strict` to ALSO refuse typing into a password
                      field inside an ordinary window, which costs an
                      a11y tree walk and is therefore opt-in
  HYPRUSE_STRICT      refuse to act when the seat moved without hypruse
                      since its last action (human or app took over)
  HYPRUSE_MARK        tag every agent-owned window `hypruse-owned` and flash
                      an on-screen notice when the agent opens a window or
                      captures the screen; also best-effort installs a
                      border_color windowrule on that tag (add it to your
                      config for a guaranteed outline, since a runtime rule
                      does not render on every Hyprland version/config)

The server calls the guard_* functions inside each acting tool; a raised
TrustError becomes the tool's error, which the MCP client surfaces.

Three checks are ALWAYS on, no env var, because they are truthfulness
aids rather than opt-in policy: covering_layer/guard_covering_layer (a
click aimed under a launcher or on-screen-keyboard layer surface would
land on the layer, not the window), guard_keyboard_layer (a launcher
holds the keyboard grab, so synthetic keys go to it no matter which
window was focused), and guard_session_lock (the session is locked, so
all input reaches a credential prompt). All are positive-detection, and
the lock check is best-effort. While HYPRUSE_AUTH_GUARD is on (the
default), though, pointer, click_ui and keyboard refuse when the layer
list cannot be read, since an authentication prompt drawn as a layer
cannot be ruled out.
